* make ids derived rather than arbitrary
** to avoid a problem where changing the model (in a way that causes ids to be assigned differently) invalidates all the ids in other commands
** I (Ben) think that a better approach is to make the id a hash of type name + unique domain details
* use a real database for view data
** relational, with materialized views?
** are there nosql dbs that will handle the updates?
* sensible logging
